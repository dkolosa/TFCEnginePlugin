	A message should appear saying that the file was registered successfully

Verify Install:
	Open a scenario in STK in the menu bar Utilities -> Component Browser
	In the component browser look into the Engine Models folder, 
	you should see six engine models starting with Thrust Fourier... in the entries

	In the compoenent browser look into Propogator Functions -> Plugins
	you should see TFC Alpha EOM in the entries


Configure Scenario:
	In the MCS scripts directory, run the TFC_driver.m script in MATLAB.
