# TFC Engine Plugin 
This is software plugin to create a set of Fourier Thrust Coefficient engine plugins for use in STK Astrogator. The Engine models are developed using STK's API.


## TFCEnginePlugin
The Engine plugin based on Fourier Thrust Coefficients using the RSW coordinate frame. 

## User Variables
The equations of motion (EOM) plugin for use with the Fourier Coefficents in STK.

## MCS Script
Set of matlab scripts to setup an STK Astrogator scenario using the TFC engine plugin. Run TFC_driver.m to setup the STK scenario.
	* Note: Must have the STK Connector with Matlab to use this feature found [here](http://help.agi.com/stk/index.htm#install/MATLABsetup.htm).

## Debug
Contains the complied .dlls and other necessary files to integrate an Engine plugin with STK.

See Install.txt for instructions on installing the engine plugin into STK
